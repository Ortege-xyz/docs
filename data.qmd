If you're looking to be heavily involved in Ortege, then this will be one of the most important areas to understand.

Our data is deployed as [Delta Lake tables](https://docs.delta.io/latest/quick-start.html) and adhere to the following naming conventions. 

* All databases/schemas will be named `db_*blockchain*` so for example, `db_eth` or `db_bitcoin`
* All entities in the database will be either tables (denoted by `tbl_`), views (denoted by `vw_`) or a materialized view (denoted by `mvw_`)
* Those entities will then be following the environment the data is related to. Either one of dev, test or prod. As example, a table of blocks would be called `tbl_prod_blocks`
* We'd also like to include what layer the data is part of. We follow a [Medallian Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse/medallion). So we want to denote either br for bronze, sl for silver or gld for gold. This means our block table now becomes `tbl_prod_br_blocks`

# Chains supported
We are planning on going live on 31st January with the bronze layer for the following chains:
* Bitcoin
* Ethereum
* Avalanche

# Data Ontology
## Blockchains
**TODO** Add some data here explaining the different classifications of Blockchains. Link to some Jon Charbaneu stuff.

## Account Types
An important distinction between blockchains is their ledger model. This indicates how the underlying blockchain ledger records information about token transfers and balances. The two major classifcations are:
* [UTXO](https://www.horizen.io/academy/utxo-vs-account-model/)
* [Accounts based model](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/utxo-vs-account-models)

In our Data Ontology we classify Blockchains as below:

| Blockchain          | Account Type | VM Type     |

| Bitcoin             | UTXO         | dumb        |
