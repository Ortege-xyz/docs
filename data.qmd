If you're looking to be heavily involved in Ortege, then this will be one of the most important areas to understand.

Our data is deployed as [Delta Lake tables](https://docs.delta.io/latest/quick-start.html) and adhere to the following naming conventions. 

* All databases/schemas will be named `db_*blockchain*` so for example, `db_eth` or `db_bitcoin`
* All entities in the database will be either tables (denoted by `tbl_`), views (denoted by `vw_`) or a materialized view (denoted by `mvw_`)
* Those entities will then be following the environment the data is related to. Either one of dev, test or prod. As example, a table of blocks would be called `tbl_prod_blocks`
* We'd also like to include what layer the data is part of. We follow a [Medallian Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse/medallion). So we want to denote either br for bronze, sl for silver or gld for gold. This means our block table now becomes `tbl_prod_br_blocks`

# Chains supported
We are planning on going live on 31st January with the bronze layer for the following chains:
* Bitcoin
* Ethereum
* Avalanche
