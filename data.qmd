# Chains supported
Currently we support Ethereum and Avalanche. If you'd like us to support a new chain, please reach out to christos@ortege.io

# Data structure
We classify data as structured, unstructured or semi structured.

We then further break down data into it's source. Namely on chain and off chain data.

On chain data is data that is occuring on that blockchain, things like trading statistics and block production. 

Off chain data is any data that doesn't occur on chain. Data sources like Twitter and Centralized Exchange pricing datapoints are off chain data even if they deal with blockchains. 

## Organisation
We break our data down into 3 layers:
* Bronze - Raw structured and unstructured data
* Silver - Cleaned up to be more human readable. Still very broad
* Gold - Very specific datasets

### Bronze
#### Tables
Our tables follow the following format:
`tbl + environment + layer + entity`

We have the following tables on all EVM chains in the bronze layer:
* tbl_prod_br_blocks
* tbl_prod_br_contracts
* tbl_prod_br_logs
* tbl_prod_br_receipts
* tbl_prod_br_transactions

#### Views
* vw_prod_br_addresses

### Silver

### Gold
Currently we are only focusing on research datasets in the Gold layer. These datasets will be materialized views and be updated every 5 minutes. They will be used to power our [Research Articles](research.qmd).

#### Views
Our views follow the following format:
`vw + environment + layer + research + blockchain`

* vw_prod_gld_research_btc
