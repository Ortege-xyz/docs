# Bitcoin

Bitcoin data follows a UTXO model. We expose two raw tables:

1.  Blocks
2.  Transactions

## Transactions

Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. Transactions will always originate from externally owned accounts, a smart contract can not initiate a transaction.

Transactions need to be broadcast to the whole network. Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM; after this happens, a miner will execute the transaction and propagate the resulting state change to the rest of the network.

## Logs

Event Logs tables store all logs data that gets generated by smart contracts.

This can be useful for querying contracts that are not yet decoded or are not able to be decoded since the code of the smart contract is not public.

Logs are an elegant way to store tiny amounts of data on EVM blockchains for a small amount of gas. Specifically, event logs are useful to let other people know something has happened without them having to query contracts individually.
