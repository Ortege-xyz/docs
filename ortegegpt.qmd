OrtegeGPT is the primary way we'd like our users to discover Ortege. All our documentation in this site is deployed into our own Large Language Model, or LLM. We then deploy this as a chat agent that our users can utilise in order to discover Ortege and it's suite of products. 

Our first chat agent is called Asimov and is in active development at the moment. 

While he is not deployed at present, he should be up and running in the next few weeks and deployed via [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces).
