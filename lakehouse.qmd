We host our lakehouse on Azure Storage. So we do incur costs for it. We want to make our Lakehouse available to all, and at present is currently available through [Ortege Studio](studio.qmd).

Please read our [Data Ontology](data.qmd) in order to acquaint yourself with how the data is structured throughout all Ortege products.
