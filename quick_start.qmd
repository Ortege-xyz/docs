## Data Exploration

Please connect to:

-   Database = "Ortege Lakehouse Test"

-   Schema = "bitcoin"

Now please run the following SQL Query:

``` sql
SELECT 
    tx.block_number - tx.block_number % 1000 AS block_number,
    ox.script_pub_key.type,
    COUNT(*) AS output_count
FROM 
    bitcoin.transactions tx
CROSS JOIN 
    UNNEST(tx.output) AS ox
WHERE 
    tx.is_coinbase
GROUP BY 
    1, 2
ORDER BY 
    1;
```

This query looks at transactions on Bitcoin whereby miners are rewarded for mining blocks and is categorized according to the output type of the transaction.

**Please note:** A coinbase transaction has to do with a type of transaction that appears in every new block of a blockchain and is not to be confused with the Coinbase Centralized Exchange. [Please see here for more information.](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-coinbase-transaction)
