# Inserting data from Ortege Lakehouse
The great thing about Quarto is that you can embed code. That means you'll be able to embed code directly into your Ortege Researh article and when the article gets accepted, the code will be executed and the results of the code displayed in your research article.

# Missing Datasets
If your research report needs data that isn't in our lakehouse, you have a few options in order to get the data into our lakehouse.
1. Send us the Parquet files of the dataset
2. Create a `pipeline` by submitting a PR to Ortege's open source [ETL codebase](https://github.com/Ortege-xyz/etl)
3. Reach out to the team to discuss a joint effort
