## Transactions
**tbl_test_br_transactions**

This table catalogs the individual transactions on the Stellar blockchain, capturing the essence of each financial event. Each entry includes the transaction's unique identifier, its status, the associated ledger number, and precise timing information. It details the transaction fee, operation count, and the XDR (External Data Representation) information for envelopes, results, and fee meta, which encapsulates the transaction in a standardized format for interoperability. Furthermore, the table stores memo-related data, crucial for transaction annotation, along with a count and array of signatures verifying the transaction. This dataset is invaluable for tracing Stellar transactions, understanding fee structures, and examining transactional metadata for analysis and verification.
