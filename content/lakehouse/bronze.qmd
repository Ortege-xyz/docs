# Address book (db_address_book)
Ortege Lakehouse distinguishes itself with a dedicated address book database that consolidates wallet addresses across various blockchains into a single unified repository. This unique design supports ML and AI-driven cross-chain analytics, enabling a comprehensive understanding and deeper insights into the entire crypto ecosystem from one source of truth.

## General
These tables cover addresses across multiple blockchains and aren't blockchain specific

### tbl_test_br_address_labels
Classifies blockchain addresses based on their associated activities. Currently, this table includes Bitcoin addresses known for participating in Stacks (STX) token stacking. This table allows users to quickly identify and analyze addresses that are active in specific blockchain operations.

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                              |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| address     | String  | The unique identifier for a wallet on the blockchain.     |
| blockchain  | String  | The name of the blockchain network, e.g., 'bitcoin'.      |

## Bitcoin
These tables specifically focus on Bitcoin and interesting wallets in the Bitcoin ecosystem

### Wallet first seen (tbl_test__br_address_bitcoin_first_seen)
This table returns all wallets on Bitcoin as well as the date the address was first seen

### Wallet size (tbl_test_br_bitcoin_wallet_size)
This table classifies all Bitcoin addresses by their BTC holdings. We classify wallets as:

* < 1 BTC Shrimp
* Between 1 BTC and < 10 BTC Crap
* Between 10 BTC and < 100 BTC Fish
* Between 100 BTC and < 1K BTC Shark

## tbl_prod_br_transactions
This table provides a detailed ledger of transactions within the Bitcoin chain, capturing both the technical aspects and the economic activities of each transaction. It records the transaction's metadata, such as its unique identifier (id), the block_hash it belongs to, its block_height and timing (block_date and block_time), and its placement within the block (index). The table delves into the composition of transactions, detailing the number and total value of inputs (input_count and input_value) and outputs (output_count and output_value), alongside arrays of input and output objects for granular transaction analysis. It also highlights whether a transaction is a coinbase transaction, indicating a miner's reward (is_coinbase), the transaction fees involved (fee), and technical parameters like hex representation, lock_time, size, version, and virtual_size. This comprehensive transactional overview aids in understanding the flow of bitcoins, transaction costs, and the operational dynamics of the Bitcoin blockchain.

## tbl_prod_br_contracts
The table records details of smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It tracks the transaction hash (tx_hash), whether the contract is the main (canonical) version, the contract's address, and the associated block number. Contract-specific data like Clarity language version (clarity_version), source code, and ABI (Application Binary Interface) are also stored. Additionally, flags indicate if the contract pertains to a STX20 token (is_stx20) or a non-fungible token (is_nft), offering insights into the contract's purpose and functionality. This table is vital for developers and analysts interested in smart contract deployment and usage patterns on Stacks.
