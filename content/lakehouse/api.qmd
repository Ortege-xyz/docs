# Getting Started
## Authentication
To begin using the Ortege Lakehouse APIs, you'll need an API access key. Please reach out to adbullah@ortege.io in order to obtain an API key.

Once you have your access key, you're ready to make your first API call. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```bash
curl --location 'https://adb-6741955360293064.4.azuredatabricks.net/api/2.0/sql/statements/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_KEY' \
--data '{
  "warehouse_id": "e6dba8cfba439486",
  "catalog": "external",
  "statement": "select * FROM db_pricing.tbl_prod_br_prices WHERE symbol = '\''STX'\'' LIMIT 10"
}'
```

Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` with your actual access key and your_dataset with the dataset you wish to query.

**PLEASE NOTE** Currently we don't rate limit API responses and as such some of the queries could return over a billion rows. Please always include LIMITs in your SQL queries. Our monitoring systems will know if you go over our limits and your API key may be revoked. 


# Best Practices
* **Secure Your API Key:** Treat your API key as you would a password. Do not share it or expose it in client-side code.
* **Optimize Queries:** To ensure efficient use of resources, optimize your SQL queries before execution.
* **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on your API usage to ensure it aligns with your project's needs and adjust as necessary.
