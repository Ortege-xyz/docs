# Customizing Charts
1. Styling Options: Use the chart's styling options to enhance its appearance. You can adjust colors, fonts, axis labels, and legends to make your chart more informative and visually appealing.
2. Interactive Features: Enhance user interaction by enabling tooltips, clickable elements, and drill-down capabilities. These features make your charts more engaging and informative.
