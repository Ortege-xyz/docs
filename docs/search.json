    "text": "If you‚Äôre looking to be heavily involved in Ortege, then this will be one of the most important areas to understand.\nOur data is deployed as Delta Lake tables and adhere to the following naming conventions.\n\nAll databases/schemas will be named db_*blockchain* so for example, db_eth or db_bitcoin\nAll entities in the database will be either tables (denoted by tbl_), views (denoted by vw_) or a materialized view (denoted by mvw_)\nThose entities will then be following the environment the data is related to. Either one of dev, test or prod. As example, a table of blocks would be called tbl_prod_blocks\nWe‚Äôd also like to include what layer the data is part of. We follow a Medallian Architecture. So we want to denote either br for bronze, sl for silver or gld for gold. This means our block table now becomes tbl_prod_br_blocks\n\n\nChains supported\nWe are planning on going live on 31st January with the bronze layer for the following chains: * Bitcoin * Ethereum * Avalanche"
