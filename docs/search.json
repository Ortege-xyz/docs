Either one of dev, test or prod. As example, a table of blocks would be called tbl_prod_blocks\nWe‚Äôd also like to include what layer the data is part of. We follow a Medallian Architecture. So we want to denote either br for bronze, sl for silver or gld for gold. This means our block table now becomes tbl_prod_br_blocks\n\n\nChains supported\nWe are planning on going live on 31st January with the bronze layer for the following chains: * Bitcoin * Ethereum * Avalanche"
