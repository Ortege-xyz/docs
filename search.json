Either one of dev, test or prod. As example, a table of blocks would be called tbl_prod_blocks\nWe‚Äôd also like to include what layer the data is part of. We follow a Medallian Architecture. So we want to denote either br for bronze, sl for silver or gld for gold. This means our block table now becomes tbl_prod_br_blocks\n\n\nChains supported\nWe are planning on going live on 31st January with the bronze layer for the following chains: * Bitcoin * Ethereum * Avalanche"

However we‚Äôd encourage you to rather use OrtegeGPT for a better experience in finding the information you require.\nElse our documentation is divided into: * Ortege Studio * Data Topology * Research articles\nThis documentation is open source and community generated. Please submit a PR if you see anything wrong.\nOur documentation is written in Quarto and will be stored in a Milvus vector database which will periodically update our early stage chat bots."
