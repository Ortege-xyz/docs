That means you’ll be able to embed code directly into your Ortege Researh article and when the article gets accepted, the code will be executed and the results of the code displayed in your research article.\nLet’s unpack that by adding a bar char of Bitcoin Hash power over the past month.\n\n\nMissing Datasets\nIf your research report needs data that isn’t in our lakehouse, you have a few options in order to get the data into our lakehouse. 1. Send us the Parquet files of the dataset 2. Create a pipeline by submitting a PR to Ortege’s open source ETL codebase 3. Reach out to the team to discuss a joint effort"
